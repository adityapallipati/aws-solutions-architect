## Create a new bucket

```sh
aws s3api create-bucket \
--bucket acl-example-ap-12345 \
--region us-east-1
```

**Note**: You'll need two AWS Accounts for this demo. This is meant to demonstrate processes that happen across different accounts. Reference what ACLs are in the S3 README.md.[Link Text](../README.md)

## Turn off Block Public Access for ACLs
